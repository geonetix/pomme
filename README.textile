Hi. This is pomme, an IRC bot. It is completely extensible and it also rules. Features are added and bugs are fixed when I run into them. I basically only use this bot on two networks; one being quakenet, the other being private (no, you can't have access).

It uses irclib, I included it because some OSes (freeBSD) have trouble installing it as it's hardly updated and I don't even know what the fuck. On that note, pomme does run on freeBSD, linux and mac os X. So it's multi platform. Sort of.
